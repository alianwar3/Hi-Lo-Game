# Hi-Lo-Game
This is simple application using HTML, JavaScript, and DOM. It accepts a users name, a maximum number, and users guess. After the user enters a maximum number a random number is generated between 1 and the max number. Each time the user enters a number it narrows down the allowable guessing range. Once the user has guessed the correct number it will allow them to reset the game.
